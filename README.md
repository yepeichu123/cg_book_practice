## chapter 2

1. background 
   
2. draw a point with changing size

3. detectException

4. readShaderSource

5. drawTriangle

6. triangleMoving


**To run the code, we should install the two library**:

> sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev

> sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

> sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev


**if you want to run the test code, maybe you should install GLUT**:

>   


**if you want to save the image, maybe you should install OpenCV 3**:

> you should compile from source code.


**There are some problems about glew, which can visit the [website](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Loading_Library)**.


## chapter 3

1. transformPoint

> Note that we need glm to define the data type.


## chapter 4

1. drawCube

2. drawCubeColor

3. drawCubeRotate

4. drawMultipleCubes

5. drawMultipleCubesInstance

6. drawMultipleGeometries

7. drawPlanets

> Note that we can modify the camera position(bigger z) to see more things.
