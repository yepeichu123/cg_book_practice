**To run the code, we should install the two library**:

> sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev

> sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

> sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev


**if you want to run the test code, maybe you should install GLUT**:

> sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev


**if you want to save the image, maybe you should install OpenCV 3**:

> you should compile from source code.


**There are some problems about glew, which can visit the [website](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Loading_Library)**.
